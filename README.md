# Simple NLP Preprocessing Pipeline
Provides a simple example showing how a function can be used to create a preprocessing pipeline for common natural language processing tasks. This example defines a function 'preprocess()' which will perform sentence and word tokenization, part of speech tagging, and named entity chunking on whatever sample text is provided.

## Overview
This example defines a function to perform common preproccessing tasks in the context of natural language processing. This function is implemented using Python and the natural language toolkit (NLTK). NLTK provides a rich library of native capabilites including the tokenization, part of speech tagging, and named entity chunking methods used in this implementation.

## Example Input and Output
Here is a screenshot of the code with a sample input, and the resulting output, when the text data is passed to the 'preprocess()' function.
